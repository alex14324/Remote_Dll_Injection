Introduction

DLL injection is a technique used to run code within the address space of another process. This method can be used for various purposes, including debugging, hooking, and sometimes malicious activities. This project aims to provide a clear understanding of how remote DLL injection works in a controlled and ethical environment.
Installation
Prerequisites

    Windows operating system
    Visual Studio (or any compatible C/C++ compiler)
    Basic understanding of C/C++ programming

Steps

    Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/alex14324/Remote_Dll-Injection.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd remote-dll-injection

    Build the project using Visual Studio or your preferred compiler.

Usage

Example

To use the DLL injection functionality, compile the Injector.cpp file and run it with the target process ID and the path to the DLL you wish to inject:

Injector.exe <TargetProcessID> <PathToDLL>

Replace <TargetProcessID> with the ID of the target process and <PathToDLL> with the full path to your DLL.
Notes

    Ensure you have the necessary permissions to inject into the target process.
    Testing should be done in a controlled environment.

Technical Details

This implementation utilizes the following Windows API functions:

    OpenProcess
    VirtualAllocEx
    WriteProcessMemory
    CreateRemoteThread

Each of these functions plays a crucial role in the injection process, allowing the injector to allocate memory within the target process and execute the DLL.
Ethical Considerations

While understanding DLL injection can provide valuable insights into software security and development, it is critical to use this knowledge responsibly. The techniques discussed in this repository should never be applied to unauthorized systems or for malicious purposes.
Reminder:

    Always obtain explicit permission before testing on any system.
    Use this knowledge for ethical hacking, security research, or educational purposes only.
